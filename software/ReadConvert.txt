This program reads the output file from the BDS program and calculates
the ols regression values for the slopes of the observed ln(Cm) versus
ln(epsilon) lines. For the iid case these are in theory equal to m.

This program assumes that m = 2,...,10 and that there are 41 values
of epsilon.

The program CONVERT.EXE runs under DOS and needs to have LIST.COM in
the same directory. The data files can be in any directory.
